# Design Ethos (Purpose)

The design principles and its related ethos was inspired from a blend of sleek gradients (the current generation of design with flat UI) and "brutualist"/"raw" design from analytical websites such as Bloomberg. This unique blend juxtaposes each other in a tasteful manner which reflects my personality as a whole.

Due to the nature of the purpose, a desktop-first approach (Macbook, iPad) was in mind rather than mobile. 
 
It employs a contrasting colour palette of Blues, Pinks/Light-reds, Blacks, Whites (monochromatic) and pastille/cream whites for content boxes.

The main design focus was drawn back to the "raw" design mentality where the typography and clean visual hierarchy is centre-stage instead of complications such as excessive images which distract away from the clean UI.

However, text, progress bars were designed in the gradient/flat UI.

# Design Process


# Project Timeline

Similar to trello, the process of the project revolved around inspiration for design,mockups with design on Figma, mental aspects of designs, visiting beautiful, simple yet functional websites such as:

www.bloomberg.com
www.stripe.com
www.nytimes.com
https://1stwebdesigner.com/inspiration-brutalist-web-design/

After conceiving of designs, this was created in a final sketch in Figma. This was consequently approved and then the development of the website commenced with a focus on modularity rather building an entire monolith.

Therefore, the website was built on a component-first approach. This is where components were initially developed (in a canonical navigation/drectory order) and then these components were replicated and then stitched together to create the overall webpage.

Afterwards, design considerations for mobile were undertaken by ensuring that for small viewports, relevant media queries were utilised to hide the navigation and components that were not optimised for mobile were altered to display the content as best as possible despite the lack of real estate.
