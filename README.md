# Design Ethos (Purpose)

The design principles and its related ethos was inspired from a blend of sleek gradients (the current generation of design with flat UI) and "brutualist"/"raw" design from analytical websites such as Bloomberg. This unique blend juxtaposes each other in a tasteful manner which reflects my personality as a whole.

It employs a contrasting colour palette of Blues, Pinks/Light-reds, Blacks, Whites (monochromatic) and pastille/cream whites for content boxes.

The main design focus was drawn back to the "raw" design mentality where the typography and clean visual hierarchy is centre-stage instead of complications such as excessive images which distract away from the clean UI.

However, text, progress bars were designed in the gradient/flat UI.
